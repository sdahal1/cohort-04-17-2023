Advantages
-Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size as needed, making them useful for situations where the number of items in the list may change frequently.

Efficient insertion and deletion: Adding or removing an element from a linked list is a relatively simple operation that can be done quickly and efficiently.

-Low memory overhead: Linked lists use only as much memory as is necessary to store the elements in the list, whereas other data structures such as arrays typically have a fixed amount of memory allocated to them.

-No need for reallocation: When elements are inserted or deleted from an array, the entire array may need to be reallocated in memory, which can be time-consuming. Linked lists, on the other hand, do not have this problem because each element is a separate object in memory.

Disatvantages
-More memory overhead: Each element in a linked list requires extra memory to store the "next" reference, which can increase the overall memory overhead of the data structure.

-No constant-time access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not provide constant-time access to individual elements. To access a specific element in a linked list, you need to traverse the list from the head, which can take linear time in the worst case.

-Cache unfriendly: Linked list elements are not stored contiguously in memory, which can make them less cache-friendly and lead to slower performance.

-Higher overhead for traversing: Traversing a linked list requires following a reference to the next element, which can have higher overhead than simply indexing into an array.
